# Risks and Considerations

## Security Risks

### 1. API Key Exposure (HIGH RISK)

**Issue**: Anthropic API key is stored in plaintext `.env` file

**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Scenarios**:
- User accidentally shares folder with API key
- User uploads folder to personal cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
- User's computer is compromised (malware reads filesystem)
- API key committed to version control by mistake

**Impact**:
- Unauthorized API usage
- Unexpected charges to company account
- Potential data exfiltration through API calls

**Mitigation**:
- Use per-user API keys instead of shared key
- Set spending limits on API keys
- Monitor API usage regularly
- Educate users on API key security
- Use secret management service (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for production

**Cost if Compromised**: $50-$10,000+ depending on usage and detection speed

### 2. Source Code Visibility (MEDIUM RISK)

**Issue**: Python source code is visible in plain text

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM (LOW for trusted employees)

**Scenarios**:

1. **API Key Strategy**: Decide on shared vs. per-user keys
2. **ToS Review**: Verify compliance with Anthropic Terms of Service
3. **User Training**: Create acceptable use policy
4. **Code Protection**: Decide if PyInstaller/PyArmor needed

### Short-Term (First Month)

1. **Usage Monitoring**: Implement API usage tracking
2. **Update Process**: Establish manual update procedure
3. **Support Documentation**: Expand troubleshooting guides
4. **Backup Strategy**: Document database backup procedures

### Long-Term (3-6 Months)

1. **Authentication**: Consider adding user login
2. **Centralized Logging**: Implement opt-in telemetry
3. **Auto-Updates**: Build automatic update mechanism
4. **SaaS Migration**: Evaluate centralized deployment

## Acceptance Criteria

For internal company use with trusted employees, these risks are **generally acceptable** if:

✅ Employment contracts include confidentiality clauses  
✅ API keys have spending limits configured  
✅ Users are trained on acceptable use  
✅ No highly sensitive data will be processed  
✅ Regular API usage monitoring is in place  
✅ Support resources are available for issues  

## When This Approach Is NOT Recommended

❌ External users (customers/partners)  
❌ Highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare) without additional controls  
❌ Processing sensitive personal data  
❌ Large-scale deployment (50+ users)  
❌ High-value intellectual property in code  
❌ Untrusted user base  

## Conclusion

The copy-to-local deployment model provides adequate security for internal company use with trusted employees. The primary risks are:

1. **API key exposure** (mitigated by spending limits + monitoring)
2. **Source code visibility** (mitigated by employment contracts)
3. **Operational overhead** (acceptable for small deployments)

For higher security requirements, consider transitioning to a SaaS model with centralized deployment, authentication, and monitoring.
